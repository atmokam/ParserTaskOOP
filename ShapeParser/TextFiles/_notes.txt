# Note:

After doing some thinking I decided to store items in an itemgroup, this way:
unordered_map<ID, ItemBase*> items;

the only question I have is regarding the bounding box, how would we make it not draw a bounding box? It's a groupitem
after all, and if we call the group renderer it's going to draw it, when we don't need it.
