Personal notes to remember what things have been added or changed in the code

in all modules:
    check the include headers, remove the ones that are not needed
    change so dependencies move to the .cpp files that need them 











Valgrind checking command:
valgrind --leak-check=full   --show-leak-kinds=all  --track-origins=yes  --verbose  --log-file=valgrind-out.txt   ./PowerPointProject -filename ../TextFiles/text.txt
