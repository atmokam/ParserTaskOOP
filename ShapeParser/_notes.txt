Personal notes to remember what things have been added or changed in the code

in addcommand:
   there are references to methods in the class Director that arent defined. 
   +add to Director class:
     getCurrentSlide() -> Slide*
     getCurrentSlideIndex() -> size_t

in removecommand:
    if(director->getDocument()->size() == 1) in this line
    +add size() method to Document class

in command.cpp in some classes:
    +add IAction 

in item.hpp:
    added slideNumber
    +add initialization for slideNumber for Item class



// Q: maybe its better to keep a state inside each action 
//  so that all actions dont have to return a pointer to the opposing?
// but does it really matter? i could just return a nullptr if there is no opposing action
